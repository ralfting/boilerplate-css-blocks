# CSS Blocks Website

This repository contains the source code and content for the [CSS Blocks public website](http://www.css-blocks.com).

## Contributing
New contributors are welcome! The best way to get started is to find issue labeled "good first issue" or "help wanted". Like most open source projects, contributors are encouraged to open an issue to propose changes and iterate on ideas before investing time in coding.

## Running Locally
The CSS Blocks website is built with React and Webpack using an ejected [create-react-app](./create-react-app.md). All you need to do to get started is:

```bash
$ yarn install
$ yarn start
```
