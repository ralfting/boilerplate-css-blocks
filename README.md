# CSS Blocks Website

This repository contains the source code and content for the [CSS Blocks public website](http://www.css-blocks.com).

## Contributing
New contributors are welcome! The best way to get started is to find issue labeled "good first issue" or "help wanted". Like most open source projects, contributors are encouraged to open an issue to propose changes and iterate on ideas before investing time in coding.

## Running Locally
The CSS Blocks website is built with React and Webpack using an ejected [create-react-app](./create-react-app.md). All you need to do to get started is:

```bash
$ yarn install
$ yarn start
```

To run a production build, use:

```bash
$ yarn run build
```

To serve the production build's assets locally, you can run the "production" file server with:

```bash
$ yarn run serve
```

## API Documentation

The API documentation is generated by Typedoc at the root of the CSS Block monorepo. When build in the monorepo's root using `yarn run docs`, the generated documentation is built to `packages/@css-blocks/website/public/api`.

The custom Typedoc theme used by CSS Blocks is located at `packages/@css-blocks/website/typedocs-theme`.
